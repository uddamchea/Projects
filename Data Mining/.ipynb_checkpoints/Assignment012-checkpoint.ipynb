       "\"\\nDifferent statistical algorithms have been developed to implement association rule mining, and Apriori is one such \\nalgorithm. In this article we will study the theory behind the Apriori algorithm.\\n\\nTheory of Apriori Algorithm\\nThere are three major components of Apriori algorithm:\\n\\nSupport\\nConfidence\\nLift\\nWe will explain these three concepts with the help of an example.\\n\\nSuppose we have a record of 1 thousand customer transactions, and we want to find the Support, Confidence, and Lift \\nfor two items e.g. burgers and ketchup. Out of one thousand transactions, 100 contain ketchup while 150 contain a \\nburger. Out of 150 transactions where a burger is purchased, 50 transactions contain ketchup as well. Using this data,\\nwe want to find the support, confidence, and lift.\\n\\n***Support***\\nSupport refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding number of transactions \\ncontaining a particular item divided by total number of transactions. Suppose we want to find support for item B. \\nThis can be calculated as:\\n\\nSupport(B) = (Transactions containing (B))/(Total Transactions)  \\nFor instance if out of 1000 transactions, 100 transactions contain Ketchup then the support for item Ketchup can be \\ncalculated as:\\nSupport(Ketchup) = (Transactions containingKetchup)/(Total Transactions)\\nSupport(Ketchup) = 100/1000  \\n                 = 10%\\n***Confidence***\\nConfidence refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding\\nthe number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is \\nbought. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\\n\\nConfidence(A→B) = (Transactions containing both (A and B))/(Transactions containing A)  \\nComing back to our problem, we had 50 transactions where Burger and Ketchup were bought together. While in 150 \\ntransactions, burgers are bought. Then we can find likelihood of buying ketchup when a burger is bought can be \\nrepresented as confidence of Burger -> Ketchup and can be mathematically written as:\\n\\nConfidence(Burger→Ketchup) = (Transactions containing both (Burger and Ketchup))/(Transactions containing A)\\nConfidence(Burger→Ketchup) = 50/150  \\n                           = 33.3%\\nYou may notice that this is similar to what you'd see in the Naive Bayes Algorithm, however, the two algorithms are meant for different types of problems.\\n\\n***Lift***\\nLift(A -> B) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by \\ndividing Confidence(A -> B) divided by Support(B). Mathematically it can be represented as:\\nLift(A→B) = (Confidence (A→B))/(Support (B))  \\nComing back to our Burger and Ketchup problem, the Lift(Burger -> Ketchup) can be calculated as:\\n\\nLift(Burger→Ketchup) = (Confidence (Burger→Ketchup))/(Support (Ketchup))\\n\\nLift(Burger→Ketchup) = 33.3/10  \\n                     = 3.33\\nLift basically tells us that the likelihood of buying a Burger and Ketchup together is 3.33 times more than the \\nlikelihood of just buying the ketchup. A Lift of 1 means there is no association between products A and B. Lift of \\ngreater than 1 means products A and B are more likely to be bought together. Finally, Lift of less than 1 refers to \\nthe case where two products are unlikely to be bought together.\\n\""
